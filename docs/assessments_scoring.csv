<p>  The “Anxiety” topic materials on AfterDeployment can be accessed below or under the Topics button on the main page. Concerns with  anxiety can be accompanied by problems with depression, general stress, post-traumatic stress and sleep.  Anxiety can also create a desire to increase alcohol, drug, or tobacco use in an attempt to reduce symptoms. Concern about what others might think of your experience can also create a reluctance to consult with mental health providers when necessary because of an unrealistic fear of stigma. You can find these topics listed here, or under the Topics button on the main page. From any of these topic pages you can jump into an assessment or access the library booklet and other resources for that topic.</p>        <p><a href=""http://AfterDeployment.dcoe.mil/topics-anxiety"">Anxiety</a></p><p><a href=""http://AfterDeployment.dcoe.mil/topics-depression"">Depression</a></p><p><a href=""http://AfterDeployment.dcoe.mil/topics-sleep"">Sleep</a></p><p><a href=""http://AfterDeployment.dcoe.mil/topics-post-traumatic-stress"">Post-Traumatic Stress</a></p><p><a href=""http://AfterDeployment.dcoe.mil/topics-life-stress"">Life Stress</a></p><p><a href=""http://AfterDeployment.dcoe.mil/topics-alcohol-drugs"">Alcohol and Drugs</a></p><p><a href=""http://AfterDeployment.dcoe.mil/topics-tobacco"">Tobacco</a></p><p><a href=""http://AfterDeployment.dcoe.mil/topics-stigma"">Stigma</a></p>_x000D_

However, you have qualified your confidence in your ability to rely completely on the meaning you find in spirituality.  It is not at all uncommon for trauma, distress, or disappointment to create doubts about some aspects of one’s spiritual beliefs.    If the resulting spiritual struggle is temporary it is likely to have little effect on either your well-being or resilience.  However, even moderate amounts of unresolved, chronic spiritual tension, in the form of anger, resentment or a sense of abandonment, significantly increase the likelihood of physical and emotional problems.   If you would like personal support in examining your spiritual beliefs and disappointments, many spiritual traditions encourage this type of exploration.  In addition to its protective effects on health and well-being, many people find that the process of resolving spiritual struggle leads to personal and spiritual growth.

You describe yourself as someone who is experiencing significant spiritual conflict in response to stressful experiences. </p>,"<p>Your score suggests that you are feeling a high level of tension based on doubts about beliefs  about your spirituality which may have previously helped you to cope with difficulties in life.   This might be because you have experienced significant trauma and have been unable to reconcile that experience with your beliefs.  Many people find themselves questioning long held beliefs in response to trauma, illness, or disappointments.  However,   research suggests that high levels of spiritual struggle, even in the short term, can lead to a great deal of distress, significantly impacting health and well-being.  The longer the tension remains unresolved, the greater the likelihood of serious physical and emotional problems.  Because of the potential impact of your current level of spiritual struggle on your health and well-being, we strongly suggest that you work to resolve the tension you are experiencing.   If you would like personal support in examining your spiritual beliefs and disappointments, many spiritual traditions encourage this type of exploration.
