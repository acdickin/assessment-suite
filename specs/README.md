This directory contains some jest tests for demonstration purposes.
It also contains preprocessor.js which runs any necessary transforms
for all tests within the app. Most directories within the src/ will
have a __test__ director where the tests are housed. The tests in these
directories should mirror the files they are testing.

Again actuall tests for this app are included throughout the src/ directory

npm run test
